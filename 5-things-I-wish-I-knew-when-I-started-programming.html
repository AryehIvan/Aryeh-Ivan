                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1"> As I rapidly typed code in Bash like interface trying to hack the FBI, I quickly realized that their engineers had intercepted the attack and countered my move wth the 'DG-95XRQ' algorithm, so I had to quickly exit and route my IP address to China, was a tale of a hollywood movie. Was I disappointed maybe, do I regret learning programming no, but here are the five things I do wish I knew.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Work Smarter Not Harder</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Code can get complicated very easily and very quickly, working smarter allows you as a software engineer/developer to come up with code solutions that are shorter and more efficient to avoid code complexity, saving you and your team of programmers time and reduces bugs.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Learning Programming Isn't Easy</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">This doesn't mean it's impossible to learn code, it just means you need to be extremely invested otherwise you will crash and burn. Then again the amount of commitment needed is what makes it worth it.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Collaboration Is Key</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">When you go through school you are taught to be competitive, your fellow classmates are competiton it's all a rat race, but not with programming. The tech community is highly collaborative, it didn't feel natural at first but with time and support from those I'd consider senior devs even at larger corporations like Microsoft and Amazon, I quickly got used to the culture of collaborating and asking questions.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Mistakes Are Okay</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">In software engineering, you are bound to get error messages regularly, the crucial part is what you do after getting errors, you can feel bad about yourself and quit or actually appreciate you make mistakes, learn from them and grow.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Take A Break</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Rebooting is highly crucial, taking time off will not only benefit you physically but mentally too. Alot of the time you will be consumed by functions that look correct but just won't run, take time to compose yourself and enjoy life, then keep coding. </p>
