                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">'Hey, I need your help I think someone hacked my account, please help me', is a plea I've received numerous times, well today, I'll offer some tips for staying safe online. </p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Use Complex Passwords</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">You've probably heard this one before, but the mistake I've seen is people thinking strength lies in the number of characters their password is, well that's not totally correct, it is highly important that alongside length your password contains a mix of different characters from letters to symbols to numeric values, this will help in especially preventing what we call dictionary attacks.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Use Unique Passwords</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Okay, so you now have a complex password and you use it across your different apps you still highly vulnerable, when you create an account your data is stored in a database, if that database is hacked your data is leaked and that data can be used to gain access to your other accounts. It is thus important that you use different passwords across your applications, avoid similarity.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Enable Two-Step Authentication</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Two-Step Authentication adds an extra layer of protection, beyond your password. This will usually be a biometric like your fingerprint, or a one-time code. Websites and Apps these days come equipped with two-step authentication but still require you to approve the use of this authentication.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">View  The SSL certificate </h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Secure Sockets Layer Certification known as an SSL certificate, means that your connection is secure. Data travelling between you and the website will be encrypted. How do you check the SSL, well you simply go to the URL, if it begins with "http" or "https", an "https" means your connection is secure.</p>
                <h6 class="white-text text-darken-1">Don't Save Financial Information Online</h6>
                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-1">Now, keep in mind the is no such thing as a 100% secure system, so even sites with an SSL certificate can still get hacked, it is therefore important that you don't save your financial information online.</p>
